# Conan: Progressive Learning to Reason Like a Detective over Multi-Scale Visual Evidence  

## 🔥 Updates

🚀 **October 20, 2025** — We are excited to release [Conan-7B](https://huggingface.co/RUBBISHLIKE/Conan-7B) and its accompanying evaluation toolkit, [Conan-Eval](./Conan-Eval/)!

🚀 **September 30, 2025** — [Conan-SFT-7B](https://huggingface.co/RUBBISHLIKE/Conan-7B-SFT) has officially landed on Hugging Face!

## Introduction
Conan is an innovative Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) designed with advanced reasoning capabilities inspired by a detective's investigative process. It excels in:
1.  **Identifying multi-scale frames** of visual evidence.
2.  **Reasoning over cross-frame clues** to connect information.
3.  **Deciding plausible actions** based on its deductions.

**🏆 Performance Highlights**
Here's a glimpse of Conan's impressive capabilities:
